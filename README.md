## Gameplay

List the key of gameplay of Tepok-Nyamok:

-   Players (local or online via GameCenter) are each dealt 10 or more poker cards.

-   Players take turns placing a card face-up on a central pile while verbally calling out the card's rank (e.g., "Two," "Three," "Queen").

-   If the spoken rank matches the placed card (e.g., saying "Three" while playing a Three card), a lightning-fast tap battle ensues!

-   Players frantically tap the displayed card image on their screen, aiming to be the last one to "Tepok" (slap) the card.

-   The slowest player is penalized by receiving the entire discard pile (played cards).

-   Gameplay continues in this manner until one player remains with all the cards, becoming the unfortunate loser.
